## Installation (MacOS for now)

- Open `Terminal.app` for the following steps: 
- Install `Homebrew`, for further info visit https://brew.sh/ 
```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
- Install `Python`
```sh
brew install python
```
- Check new `python`
```
python3 --version

## Should show Python 3.9.9
```
---
## Zsh 
```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
---
## Visual Studio Code

- Install `vscode` as code editor
```sh
brew install visual-studio-code
```
- Ensure `autosave` is enabled https://stackoverflow.com/a/56480358  
- Create and open a workspace with `vscode`
```
mkdir -p ~/dev/mypy
code ~/dev/mypy
```
- Check out some basic setups for `vscode` https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics
- Install plugin for `python` tooling within `vscode` https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python

## Python Virtual Environment

- Development for a `python` app usually requires downloading variety of third-party modules. 
- It is helpful to have isolated enviroment for each app, since no app created equal. 
- Press `ctl ~` to open a terminal within `vscode`
- Create a `virtual-env` from the location of the above workspace
```
python3 -m venv ~/dev/mypy/myenv
```
- At this point `vscode` might recognize the presence of the new `virtual-env` and ask to activate. Once activated, reopen the terminal in `vscode` might show the `(myenv)` in front of the prompt signaling it's activated.
- To manually activate `virtual-env`: 
```
source ~/dev/mypy/myenv/bin/activate
```
- Use `deactivate` to exist the `virtual-env`
---
## Initialize Django 
- Create a `requirements.txt` file in the workspace location to download modules for `django` with following content:
```
Django>=3.0,<4.0
shortuuid>=1.0.1
gunicorn
```
- Make sure the `virtual-env` is activated, run following command in terminal to fetch the required modules:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- If `pip` is outdated, a message with instruction to upgrade should display.
- Generate a new `django` app at the same location of workspace:
```
django-admin startproject myapp
```
- Test run the `app` locally:
```
cd mysite
python manage.py runserver

## Should show ...Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/...
```
- Open the browser at [localhost](http://localhost:8000) to see the running website.

## Create Polling App

- For detail https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial01/#creating-the-polls-app
- Create new `module` for `polls` app in the same location of `manage.py`
```
cd mysite

cat manage.py ## making sure at same folder with manage.py

python manage.py startapp polls
``` 
- Open the file `polls/views.py` and put the following `Python` code in it:
```py
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")
```
- Create a file called `urls.py` (under same folder `polls`) with code:
```py
from django.urls import path

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
``` 
- Update `mysite/urls.py` (under folder `mysite`) with code:
```py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('polls/', include('polls.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```
- Restart the app (at root folder where `manage.py` located)
```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
- Go to http://localhost:8000/polls/ in your browser, and you should see the text “Hello, world. You’re at the polls index.”, which you defined in the index view.
